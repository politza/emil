#+TITLE: A type-system and data-structures for Emacs-Lisp

#+begin_quote
[!WARNING]
The packages in this repository are experimental.
#+end_quote

This repository contains a type-system for Emacs-Lisp and two abstractions called =Struct= and
=Trait= making use of it.

Using these tools we are able to write Lisp code like the following.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (Trait:implement Rs:Publisher Rs:Processor:EmitOnTimer
    (fn subscribe (self (subscriber (Trait Rs:Subscriber)))
      (when self.subscriber
        (error "Multiple subscriber not supported"))
      (setf self.subscriber subscriber)
      (self.publisher.subscribe self)))
#+end_src

Pleas refer to the individual packages which each have their own README.
